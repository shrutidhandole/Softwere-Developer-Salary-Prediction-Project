Overview: Developed a predictive model to estimate software developer salaries based on various factors such as experience, education, location, and skills. The project aims to provide insights for developers and recruiters regarding salary expectations.
Built a Software Developer Salary Prediction Model:

1.Collected and cleaned data from various sources including job portals and salary surveys.
2.Conducted exploratory data analysis (EDA) to identify trends and correlations between salary and factors such as experience, education, location, and skills.
3.Developed regression models including Linear Regression, Decision Tree Regression, and Random Forest Regression to predict salaries.
4.Deployed the final model using Flask to create a web application for salary prediction.
5.Visualized data and results using Matplotlib to provide actionable insights for users and recruiters.
